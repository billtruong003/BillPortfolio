Starting from junior roles, I've advanced to senior positions on projects like Shmackle, where I fix complex codebases, build efficient pipelines, and create features that drive user growth. My background has shaped a practical approach, allowing me to adapt fast and deliver in high-pressure environments. Though financial challenges led me to leave FPT University after earning a 30% Talent Scholarship, I've built my expertise through real-world projects and self-driven learning.",
