    "about": "I am a Unity Engineer with a rare edge: I dominate both the Codebase and the Render Pipeline. My core expertise is Advanced C# Programming and System Architecture, but unlike typical developers, I don't rely on others to optimize the visuals. I build complex gameplay systems, write the shaders to support them, and engineer the tools to make them performant. I am the 'Full-Stack' Game Developer who ensures the game logic is solid, the tools are efficient, and the final frame renders at 90 FPS.",
