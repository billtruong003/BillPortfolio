    "about": "A resilient Senior Unity Specialist and Technical Artist who turned financial challenges into a catalyst for professional excellence. Starting with a 30% Talent Scholarship at FPT University, I pivoted to full-time industry development to support my career, rapidly evolving from a junior developer to a Senior Technical Artist. Currently driving core development for 'Shmackle' (Live on Meta Quest 2/3/3s), I bridge the gap between deep C# architecture and high-fidelity technical art. My journey includes shipping titles at Golden Sea, gaining Enterprise Scrum experience at Gameloft, and pioneering Digital Twins at FPT akaVerse. I specialize in building tools that accelerate production and optimizing complex rendering pipelines for VR/Mobile.",
